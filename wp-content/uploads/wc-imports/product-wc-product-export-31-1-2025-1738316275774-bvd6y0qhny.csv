These were later used for different purposes which had different designs. Until then women in kitchen used easily available materials for cooking, like holding hot utensils with cloth. But this had a disadvantage of accidentally catching fire. Then pliers from casting came to rescue of women. Cooking and serving was then, much safer than earlier. Lately, pliers are known by different names in different regional languages like Pakkad, Chimta, Kitchen Tong, Utility holder and Sanchi. The basic design of pliers developed as per need and time and is now found of different made of different metals, shapes and sizes.</p>\n[gallery columns=""2"" link=""none"" size=""large"" ids=""7318,7317,7316,7315""]\n<h3 style=""text-align: center"">Why should we buy this Product?</h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center"">DMI an expert in manufacturing brass kitchenware brings you Brass Popat Sanchi and Cooker Sanchi.

One such importance is mentioned in Lalitha Sahasranamam. It is stated that a lamp represents Goddess Durga, Saraswathi and Lakshmi. Five faces in a lamp represent 5 qualities a woman needs to have, those are: Affection, Intelligence, Resoluteness, Patience and Caution. The oil in the lamp refers to mind of the woman, thus when a lamp is lit, all the above the qualities gain the importance. Lighting the souls and helping us develop the intellect, this portrays as too why diya’s should be lit.

Arti is to have descended from the vedic concept of fire ritual or homa. Everything included in aarti be it flowers or incense sticks each has something to represent. Thus, one’s entire existence and all facets of material creation are symbolically offered to the lord via the aarti ceremony. Aarti signifies that one is peripheral to godhead or divinity. It also serves as a reminder to stay vigilant so that the forces of material pleasures and desires cannot overcome the individual</p>\n[gallery columns=""2"" link=""none"" size=""large"" ids=""7311,7310,7309,7308""]\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3 style=""text-align: center"">Why buy this product?</h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center"">As the name goes Panchaarti, ‘Panch’ means five, which represent Space (Akash), Wind (Vayu), Fire (Agni), Water (Jal) and Earth (Prithvi) and so does this aarti have five faces. This Panchaarti, completed with 60-65 % of Copper is quite thick, which is durable for a long time. It is designed keeping it simple making it easy to clean. It has the modern touch pleasing to the eye gracing its looks. The cup provided highlights its feature that once the diya lit would burn for extended time.

Diya means ‘Dextoxify Your Aatma (soul)’, where oil in the diya symbolises the dirt in the human and the cotton wick symbolises the aatma or the self or the soul. The light in the lamp signifies freeing one from all forms of sadness, guiding the path to enlightenment and to connect with the Supreme Being. Definitely there are a number of oils that can be used to light the lamp, which have their own importance, but according to Vastu, lighting the lamp in ghee would be more fruitful than oil. Lamandeep known as Laman Diva in Marathi, are usually brought in pairs, considering them to be auspicious and are lit during special functions. It also believed that the Samay with odd number of faces is considered auspicious.</p>\n[gallery columns=""2"" link=""none"" size=""large"" ids=""7302,7301,7298,7299""]\n<h3 style=""text-align: center"">Why buy this product?</h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center"">Kuthuvilakku or Lamandeep is just another amazing product from the DMI’s range of products.

It naturally creates an etheric sphere around the flame. Where there is etheric sphere communication will be better. This phenomenon can be observed in campfire. When people sit around the campfire and listen to stories, their receptivity will be at its best. Thus, if you want to start anything, or you want to create a certain atmosphere, alamp is lit. This comes from the understanding that when you light a lamp, apart from the visual aspect, it fills the whole place with a different kind of energy. Everything that is driving life in this world is fire. So fire is seen as the very source of life. It also creates a field of energy around itself, and above all it creates the necessary atmosphere. So when you light a lamp before you start your day, it is because you want to bring the same quality into yourself.

Five faces in a lamp represent 5 qualities a woman needs to have, those are: Affection, Intelligence, Resoluteness, Patience and Caution. The oil in the lamp refers to mind of the woman, thus when a lamp is lit, all the above the qualities gain the importance.

These were later used for different purposes which had different designs. Until then women in kitchen used easily available materials for cooking, like holding hot utensils with cloth. But this had a disadvantage of accidentally catching fire. Then pliers from casting came to rescue of women. Cooking and serving was then, much safer than earlier. Lately, pliers are known by different names in different regional languages like Pakkad, Chimta, Kitchen Tong, Utility holder and Sanchi. The basic design of pliers developed as per need and time and is now found of different made of different metals, shapes and sizes</p>\n[gallery columns=""2"" link=""none"" size=""large"" ids=""7407,7406,7405,7404""]\n<h3 style=""text-align: center"">Why buy this Product?</h3>\n<p style=""text-align: center"">DMI an expert in manufacturing brass kitchenware brings you Brass Popat Sanchi and Cooker Sanchi.
