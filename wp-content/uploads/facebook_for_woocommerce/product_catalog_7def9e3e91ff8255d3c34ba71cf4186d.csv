Story behind pliers 
 
Pliers or tongs are an ancient invention from the time of smiting and casting metals. People needed a safe way to hold hot materials, leading to the creation of tongs. 
These tools later evolved with different designs and purposes. Initially, women in kitchens used cloth to handle hot utensils, but this was risky due to fire hazards. 
Eventually, metal pliers (known today as pakkad, chimta, or sanchi) made cooking much safer. Their design evolved over time and is now available in various materials and forms.

Significance of 5-Faced Brass Divaj 
Lighting a lamp has deep spiritual significance. In the Lalitha Sahasranamam, the lamp represents Durga, Saraswathi, and Lakshmi. 
The five faces of the Divaj symbolize key feminine qualities. Affection, intelligence, resoluteness, patience, and caution are represented through its five wicks. 
The oil represents the mind, and the flame signifies the awakening of those virtues. Bhadradeepam is lit to purify the inner self and foster spiritual growth.

Story behind pliers 
Pliers or tongs are an ancient invention from the era of smelting and metal casting. This process involved melting various metals and molding them into tools and artifacts. 
That’s when pliers were first introduced — giving people a safe grip to hold hot materials during metalwork. Over time, these tools evolved in design and function. 
Before their kitchen use, women commonly used cloth to hold hot utensils. However, this method posed a fire risk. The introduction of pliers made cooking and serving much safer. 
Today, these tools are known by different names in regional languages like Pakkad, Chimta, Kitchen Tong, Utility Holder, and Sanchi. 
Their designs have also adapted over the years. Pliers are now made in various shapes, sizes, and metals based on different household and culinary needs.

<h3 style='text-align: center;'>About Aarti/ Arti</h3>
<p style='text-align: center;'>It is believed that lamp need not be a visual aid, because we see it makes a different when a lamp is lit. It naturally creates an etheric sphere around the flame. Where there is etheric sphere communication will be better. This phenomenon can be observed in campfire. When people sit around the campfire and listen to stories, their receptivity will be at its best. Thus, if you want to start anything, or you want to create a certain atmosphere, alamp is lit. This comes from the understanding that when you light a lamp, apart from the visual aspect, it fills the whole place with a different kind of energy.</p>
Everything that is driving life in this world is fire — a belief deeply rooted in <a href='https://www.drikpanchang.com/seasons/fire/fire-element.html' target='_blank' rel='dofollow noopener'>Vedic rituals and fire worship</a>, where fire is seen as the divine purifier and connector to spiritual energy. It also creates a field of energy around itself, and above all it creates the necessary atmosphere. So when you light a lamp before you start your day, it is because you want to bring the same quality into yourself. It is symbolism; it’s a way of invoking your own inner nature. Celebrate tradition with the <a href='https://dmimart.in/product/dmis-7-faced-antique-brass-samai-peacock-design/?v=674f83e119a5' rel='dofollow'>7-Faced Brass Samai Diya</a>, intricately designed with a stunning central peacock motif.
